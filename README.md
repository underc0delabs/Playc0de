## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following to run this Framework:

- NodeJS: 
```sh
  https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  ```
- Java 8 or higher: 
```sh
  https://www.java.com/es/download/
  ```
- Allure commandline: 
```sh
  npm i allure-commandline
  ```

  ### Installation

1. Clone the repository using this project:
```sh
https://github.com/underc0delabs/playc0de
```

2. Install packages and dependencies:
```sh
npm i
```

3. If first time installation, download all browsers to run the test:
```sh
npx playwright install
```

4. Verify installation by running the following command:
```sh
ENV=qa npx playwright test
```

## Configuration

1. Review and adjust your desired configuration at `playwright.config.ts`

2. Adjust the test data for each Enviroment in `testConfig.ts`

3. If more than two Enviroments, add them in `./core/dataHandler`

### Commands


1. Run all test
```JS
ENV=qa npm run test
```

2. If you need to debug or explore test, run in watch mode:
```JS
ENV=qa npm run test:ui
```

3. Run test with specific @tag
```JS
ENV=qa npx playwright test --grep "@tag"
```

4. Generate Allure report:
```JS
npm run report
```

5. Record new test scripts:
```JS
npm run record
```

6. Open trace viewer to debg Failed test:
```JS
npm run trace
```
trace.zip file normally found at `./reports/artifacts`

7. To run test on a single browser:
```JS
ENV=qa npm run test:chrome
```
Chrome by default, but you can change on `./package.json`

7. For additional commands, you can check Playwright Docs: https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests

8. For custom commands, you should add them in `./package.json`

## Reporting

- HTML report will be generated by default
- Allure report can be generated manually after each run with the corresponding command
- Screenshots, videos and trace files will be generated in `./reports/artifacts`
- Evidence will be generated only for failed test. You can change this setting in `playwright.config.ts`

## Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps. Lighthouse will run auditos for performance, accessibility, PWA, SEO and much more. 

### Configuration

1. Open the lighthouse file in `./utils/lighthouse.js`
2. Replace the URL with the desired URL to test
3. To run audits use the following command:
```JS
npm run audit:desktop
npm run audit:mobile
```

## Docker

1. Build the image from Dockerfile. Replace "Playc0de" with the desired name for your image:
```JS
docker build . -f ./Dockerfile -t playc0de
```

2. Spawn a new container and run the test. Replace "Playc0de" with the same name as first step.
```JS
docker run --name myNewContainer playc0de
```

For command customization, kindly edit the CMD at `./Dockerfile`
